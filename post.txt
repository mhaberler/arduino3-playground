played with observers - super elegant and useful!

I tried to deal with transient values which might become unavailable (e.g. BLE beacon out of reach)

In my example I dealt with invalidation by setting a magic value (INT_MAX) in a timeout and detecting this in the observer callback
so a label or color can be set accordingly

maybe there's a more general way to convey "not available" to an observer?


what about a user_data member in lv_subject_t which observers can inspect?
